# Ecological Network Generator 

:warning: work in progress :warning:

Creating ecological networks is a time intensive task. This template is meant to help facilitate the creation of custom network by combining existing datasets with known taxonomic resources.

# Workflow Steps

Compiling an ecological network may involve the following steps:
1. select interaction datasets (e.g., species A interacts with species B)
2. pick a taxonomic perspective (or taxonomic resource)
3. apply/align taxonomic perspective to selected interaction datasets
4. filter interactions that are in specific taxonomic range (e.g., parasite and host)
5. filter interactions that may occur in a specific geographic range (e.g., only Northwestern Wisconsin)
6. publish ecological network for further analysis, including the description of the workflows as well as the sources used (e.g., interaction datasets, taxonomic perspective, ranges)

Ecological Network -> Ecological Network Data Package 

# Example

For example of data package, see [data-package](./data-package)

Two Projects:

1. (one type of interaction: parasiteOf) Predict Hosts by Detecting Parasites (e.g., only look at selected parasite and their hosts)
2. (many kinds of interactions: eats, parasiteOf etc.) Comparing Food Webs in Urban Settings and Restored Ecosystem (e.g., What kind of parasites occur?, what ecosystem functions are gained/lost?) 


Idea:
Focus "workshop" around the first project (parasiteOf project) to build capacity, then move on to the food web project and adapt methods when needed.
